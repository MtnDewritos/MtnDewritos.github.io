A shitty website that randomly selects panels from each folder and displays them as "one" webcomic.
Doesn't actually work because I had no idea what I was doing when I made it and now I have very little clue how it works

Only worked locally on my machine somehow back then because it could somehow access data by relative file system path
Now needs to actually get the data from github somehow to make it actually work
